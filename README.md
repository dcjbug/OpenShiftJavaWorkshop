OpenShiftJavaWorkshop
=====================

OpenShift is Red Hat's Platform as a Service offering that automates the provisioning, management and scaling of applications so that you can focus on writing the code for your business, startup, or next big idea.


In this meetup, we will learn about what OpenShift is and how to get started writing our first application.  While OpenShift supports multiple languages such as Ruby, Php, Node, Python, and .Net - this talk will focus on Java application development.
